#JuliaSets
##Plotting Julia sets on Argand diagrams 

####This leads on from my EE, a brief presentation can be found here: http://prezi.com/cyg1ladocm9d/my-extended-essay-exploring-julia-sets/


Originally Javascript, but the output doesn't look like a Julia Set should. #Any Ideas why?

I've re-written the code in Python, but there are still the same errors.
Please improve my Python if it is bad, it's not my strongest language.
Also for Python, I'm looking for an easy way to output an image made up of lots of squares. Is there a way to output arrays to image file?

I'm also working on using Javascript to output the image in HTML, either canvas or as a table.

####Any help appreciated, but please don't fork!
