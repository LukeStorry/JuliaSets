##Plotting Julia sets on Argand diagrams 

####This leads on from my EE, a brief presentation can be found here: http://prezi.com/cyg1ladocm9d/my-extended-essay-exploring-julia-sets/

I've re-written the code in python, but there are some syntax errors, please let me know what is going wrong, Pyhton isn't my strong point.
Also for Python, I'm looking for an easy way to output an image made up of lots of squares.

I'm also working on using Javascript and outputting the image in HTML, wither canvas or table.

####Any help appreciated, but please don't fork!
